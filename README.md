# changetip-stats
Experimenting using the ChangeTip API to generate visual statistics
Howdy y'all!

This project stems from a discussion on the Tipping For Good Slack group where ChangeTip users were requesting visual statistics for their ChangeTip accounts. Folks want to see stats like total tips by user, % tips accepted, total amount tipped, tips over time etc.
